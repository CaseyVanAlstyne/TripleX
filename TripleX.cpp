#include <iostream>
// the above #include represents a preprocessor directive in the code, which are instructions to the compiler to, in this case, inlcude the <iostream> library into the code BEFORE compiling, which is why it can be found at the very start of our code file.
// <iostream> is the header file
// preprocessor directives do not need to end with a semicolon
